- "first language" is not compulsory until user tries to start his/her dictionary
So when word/new (or pair) is requested, the "choose first language" (or simply user profile) page should be
fetched, and when the user selects the first language and submits the form, he should be redirected to where
ha came from (word/new or pair).
- adding "first language" should automatically add this language to "languages"
